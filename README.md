# Uber-Taxi-Trips-Data-Analysis-Python
  
**Analyzing Uber trip data with Python for business and pricing insights.**
  
## Description
  
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Uber trip data using Python and popular data analysis and visualization libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The primary goal is to understand user behavior patterns and the ride-sharing market, extracting valuable insights in the areas of Business Analysis and Pricing Data Analysis.
  
The key findings focus on identifying:
  
- Peak demand times for trips.
- Trip distances and reasons for using the service.
- Geographic areas with the highest demand.
  
The project aims to demonstrate how these analyses can directly contribute to increasing the profitability of smart taxi companies, such as Baly, and improving the user experience through data-driven decisions related to driver management, dynamic pricing (Surge Pricing), targeted marketing campaigns, and route optimization.
  
The full source code for the analysis and generated visualizations is available in this repository.
